My first impression of the website is that it's pretty well designed. It looks good, and isn't to complicated.
They did a great job organizing the website. They have links at the top for stores, links on the left for
products, and different types of recipes. They did a good job differentiating between the links and the
information on the home page. The structure of the site makes sense. They have announcements at the top,
new recipes, and new products. They ordered them in a way thats easy to read and understand. The images and 
graphics help with the transitions from each section. It fits their brand, and looks good. The load time was
very quick, loaded in less than a second. The text size and color are very easy to read. Even on a bigger
monitor, I have no issues reading it. When they use an image for the background of text, all it does is
slightly change the color, nothing overlaps with the text. This makes it very readable. The website does have
a navigation tool, in the form of a search bar. However clicking on it moves it the center of the top of the
screen which seems a little weird. But it works as intended. Most of the site has a white background, with
black text. For titles and new sections they make the text red and add images. They also add heading breaks
in good spots. The site responds well to making the window smaller. All the same information is present and
available when you make it smaller. Something that I thought they did well was have all their links 
at the bottom of the website. They listed them in a nice way making it super easy to find the information you
need.
